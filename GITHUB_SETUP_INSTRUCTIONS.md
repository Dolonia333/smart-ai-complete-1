# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Creating Your GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com and sign in to your account**

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: "Smart-Local-AI-Assistant"
   - Description: "AI assistant with voice recognition, real-time web search, and desktop control"
   - Make it Public (recommended) or Private
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the repository URL** (it will look like):
   https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Local-AI-Assistant.git

## Connecting Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\zionv\OneDrive\Desktop\Smart Local Assistant"

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Local-AI-Assistant.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create the repository directly:

```powershell
# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create Smart-Local-AI-Assistant --public --description "AI assistant with voice recognition, real-time web search, and desktop control"

# Push your code
git push -u origin master
```

## What's Already Prepared for GitHub:

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed and ready
✅ .gitignore file configured
✅ README_GITHUB.md created for GitHub
✅ LICENSE file included
✅ requirements.txt for dependencies
